    <p>A twelve-factor app is always tracked in a version control system, such as
        <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>,
        <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank">Mercurial</a>, or
        <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>. A copy of the revision tracking database is known as a
        <em>code repository</em>, often shortened to
        <em>code repo</em> or just
        <em>repo</em>.</p>

    <p>A
        <em>codebase</em> is any single repo (in a centralized revision control system like Subversion), or any set of repos
        who share a root commit (in a decentralized revision control system like Git).</p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>There is always a one-to-one correlation between the codebase and the app:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If there are multiple codebases, it’s not an app – it’s a distributed system. Each component in a distributed system
            is an app, and each can individually comply with twelve-factor.</li>

        <li>Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor. The solution here is to factor shared code into
            libraries which can be included through the
            <a href="./dependencies">dependency manager</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is only one codebase per app, but there will be many deploys of the app. A
        <em>deploy</em> is a running instance of the app. This is typically a production site, and one or more staging sites.
        Additionally, every developer has a copy of the app running in their local development environment, each of which
        also qualifies as a deploy.</p>

    <p>The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy. For example, a
        developer has some commits not yet deployed to staging; staging has some commits not yet deployed to production.
        But they all share the same codebase, thus making them identifiable as different deploys of the same app.</p>
